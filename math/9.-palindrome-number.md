# 9. Palindrome Number

## Question

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Follow up:**

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Revert half of the number

For example, input is `1221`, if we revert last part of the number 12**21** from **21** to **12**, and compare with first half. 

* When `x <= reversed number`, we reach the half
* Two cases: 
  * "1221" pattern, `x == rev`.
  * "121" pattern, `x == rev / 10`, get rid of the middle digit
* Time complexity: O\(log\_10\(n\)\)
* Space complexity: O\(1\)

## Code 

```python
def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
    # -120 or 10 are not palindrome number
    if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
        return False
    rev = 0 #init reversed number
    while (x > rev):
        rev = rev * 10 + x % 10
        x = x // 10
    return x == rev or x == rev // 10
```
